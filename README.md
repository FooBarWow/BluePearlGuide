# BluePearlGuide

## Prerequisites:
You need to have the RestedXP addon installed, but you DO NOT need to have a paid subscription to their guide. This is my guide and it's free.
You can download the addon here: https://www.restedxp.com/addon/

## Download:
On the Git page  https://github.com/FooBarWow/BluePearlGuide/tree/main  you should see a BIG GREEN BUTTON that says **<> Code**. Click the button, then select Download Zip.
It will download a zip with the base folder in the zip called **BluePearlGuide-main**, then inside that is this readme and another folder called **RXPGuides_Template**. 
Yoink out the **RXPGuides_Template** folder with your favorite unzipper.

## Install:
To get this to work, you'll need to copy the folder called **RXPGuides_Template** to your addons folder. It should be next to the **RXPGuides** folder in the list, not inside it.
Your addon folder is inside the **Interface** folder in your WoW install directory. For me it's like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\AddOns

## Using the Guide:
When you're in game, you should see your RestedXP addon window has a new guide to select, **BluePearlsFarm** under **Foobar's Blue Pearl Route**. Select this and it will guide you around the safe clams while also adding unitscans and auto-marks for the nearby murlocs so you can avoid them more easily. Good luck and have fun!
